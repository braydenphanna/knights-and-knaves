- Turn based [3 rank hexagon combat system](#Images)
  - Editable default battle orientation
  - 3 person party
  - Each turn you have movement and attack(unless you're brute). You can sacrifice attack for +1 movement.
  - Damage falloff (+ means above, - means below)
  - Special class is for unique enemies
  - Due to Hexagonal setup the middle rank can attack more spots, but also can be attacked from more directions 
- World Map
- Each npc is either a knight or knave
  - Knights: can only tell the truth
  - Knaves: can only lie
- Recruitable party members who are knights/knaves
- Player character either
  - Can choose knight or knave
  - neither (leaning towards this)
- Logic puzzles
- Minigames

## Graphics
- ff9-like chibi cartoon characters
- FMVs

## Story
- Medieval Quest
- Sympathetic Knave character 
- Some npcâ€™s assignment is obvious, others not
- Player is an outsider
- Some sort of mechanism to reveal who is a knight or knave
- Some sort of higher power / wizardry assigning knights / knaves
